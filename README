* Intro

The equation app tries to solve basic equations and find values
for the variables in them.

* Build

To build this app you need:
 - Java JDK
 - Apache Ant

To build the project open a terminal and get to the equation
directory, where the build.xml and this README is. Run:

 ant

That will compile the source files and create a
dist/equation.jar file.


* Running the app

You can run this from the terminal with:

  java -jar dist/equation.jar

Or, you can double click the file.


* Usage

The app has two text areas. You can enter your equations in the top
field and the values for the variables will be generated in the bottom
field. For example:

x + x = 25 + y

will generate:

y = ((2.0 * x) - 25.0)
x = ((y + 25.0) / 2.0)

And:

y = 5
x + x = 25 + y

generates:

y = 5.0
x = 15.0
